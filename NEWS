 * 2008-02-14:
        - Fix functions: identof, is_scalar, is_vector, is_matrix,
          is_integer, is_real, is_complex, is_string, and is_numerical

          this problem.

 * 2007-12-26:
        - Cleanup of code to manage dimension lists (restricted functions
          to: yeti_reset_dimlist, yeti_grow_dimlist and
          yeti_start_dimlist).  Get rid of ynew_dim dependency which will
          be soon removed from Yorick's core.
        - Minor fix in window_geometry.

 * 2007-11-29:
        - Configuration script fixed to allow for spaces in path to Yorick
          executable and modified to have defaults for FFTW/GSL/TIFF linker
          flags (i.e. so that only --with-fftw is needed if FFTW is installed
          in standard place).

 * 2007-10-25:
        - Function h_show now displays name of symbolic links.

        - New "global" variables: YETI_VERSION_MAJOR, YETI_VERSION_MINOR
          and YETI_VERSION_MICRO.
        - New functions (rgl_roughness_*)  for regularization based
          on roughness with various norms and boundary conditions.

===============================================================================

 * 2007-05-14: Yeti version 6.2.1 released.

 * 2007-05-11:
        - Configuration script fixed to work with Cygwin/MS-Windows and
          to allow for compilation with Yorick CVS version.
        - Yeti Hierarchical Data File (YHDF) can now store functions
          and symbolic links (by their names).

 * 2007-04-30:
        - *** POSSIBLE INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          Due to inconsistencies, the API for symbolic links has been
          reworked.  To create a symbolic link to a variable, the ambiguous
          `link` function has been deleted in favor of
          `symlink_to_variable` and `symlink_to_name`.  The functions
          `link_name`, `solve_link` and `is_link` have been renamed as
          `name_of_symlink`, `value_of_symlink` and `is_symlink`
          respectively.

===============================================================================

 * 2007-04-24: Yeti version 6.2.0 released.

 * 2007-04-24:
        - Add rules to build and install documentation of Yeti
          plugins in Yorick installation directory.

        - Bug in function `make_dimlist` fixed.

 * 2007-03-23:
        - Hash table objects can now have their own evaluator, which can be
          queried/set by the `h_evaluator` function.
        - New function `h_number` to query number of entries in a hash table.
        - Function `is_hash` returns 2 for a hash table object implementing
          its own evaluator.
        - `h_clone`, `h_copy`, `h_info` and `h_show` fixed to account for the
          evaluator of an hash table object.
        - Restricted possible values for JOB/FLAGS in evaluation of
          matrix products: must be 0 (default) for direct product and
          1 for transpose product.

 * 2007-01-26:
        New interpreted function: `setup_package`.

 * 2007-01-23:
        New object type: symbolic link.  New related functions: link,
        is_link, link_name and solve_link.

        New builtin function `quick_select`.  New functions `quick_median`
        and `quick_interquartile_range` for fast estimation of the median
        and the inter-quartile range of an array of values.

===============================================================================

 * 2006-06-10: Yeti version 6.1.5 released.
        This is the first public release of Yeti which makes use of the new
        Yorick API "YAPI" and which provides support for GSL (the GNU
        Scientific Library).

 * 2006-06-10:
        - Documentation for Yeti-GSL completed.
        - Fixed inconsistency in error computation for Yeti-GSL.
        - New function h_show to display a hash table as an expanded tree.

        - Built-in function is_list removed from Yeti (it is now part of
          Yorick).

 * 2005-12-08:
        - New built-in functions: make_dimlist.

 * 2005-12-01:
        - New built-in functions: window_select, window_exists and window_list.

          Library.  At this time, the plugin provides 118 special functions
          from the GSL.
        - Fix bug in sparse_expand().
        - In about() function, explicitely filter range operators which have
          a built-in function counterpart to avoid a deadly bug in Yorick.

===============================================================================

 * 2005-09-16: Yeti version 6.0.2 released.

 * 2005-09-16: Use Yorick (instead of Bourne shell) for configuration of
        Yeti -- much more easy and protable ;-)

 * 2005-09-13: New built-in function 'machine_constant' to query machine
        dependent constant (such as DBL_EPSILON).

 * 2005-08-31: Fixed signedness of strings in yeti_hash.c to avoid
        compiler warnings.

 * 2005-08-11: Fixed bad variable name in morph_white_top_hat(),

===============================================================================

 * 2005-07-30: Yeti version 6.0.0 released.

 * 2005-07-19:
        - New functions cost_l2(), cost_l2l1() and cost_l2l0() to compute,
          L2, L2-L1 and L2-L0 cost functions and optionally their gradient.

 * 2005-06-15:
        - *** POSSIBLE INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          The old sparse matrix API has been removed in favor of a new
          sparse_matrix object class.  The new class is different from
          the old implementation: [1] it has two index lists (one for the
          rows, the other for the columns of the non-zero coefficients) to
          break the former limit on the dimension lists of input/output
          spaces; [2] the sparse matrix object can be used directly as a
          function to apply (possibly transpose) matrix multiplication; [3]
          the sparse matrix object can be used as a Yorick structure to
          query its contents.

        - *** POSSIBLE INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          The built-in function _yeti_init was renamed as yeti_init.

 * 2005-06-14:
        - New morpho-math functions: morph_dilation, morph_erosion,
          morph_opening, morph_closing, morph_white_top_hat,
          morph_black_top_hat.

 * 2005-06-03:
        - *** POSSIBLE INCOMPATIBILITY ***
          Built-in get_path() removed (conflict with same function in
          Yorick 1.6.02).  The new get_path function return a list of
          path separated by ':' into a single string whereas the
          former version built-in Yeti used to return an array of strings.

 * 2005-05-24:
        - Lots of changes to make Yeti a pure plugin for Yorick 1.6 and
          trying to maintain compatibility with previous version of Yeti.

        - Temporarily removed all the chn_* function (channel).

        - Builtin expand_path() removed in favor of filepath().

        - Built-in strlower() and strlower() replaced by interpreted
          version which use the new strcase() built-in function in
          Yorick-1.6. Similarly, strtrim() removed because it is now
          provided by Yorick-1.6 with same behaviour.

        - "yeti_fftw" and "yeti_tiff" packages no longer require Yeti to
          be loaded (they are pure standalone Yorick packages).

        - Regular expression functions regmatch(), regsub(), regcomp(), etc
          are now provided by a separate package "yeti_regex".  Two reasons
          for that: (1) new Yorick-1.6 now provides some regular expression
          engine (see strgrep), and (2) my regular expression package
          required the GNU REGEX library (built-in GNU C library).  The GNU
          REGEX library can be optionally built into the new "yeti_regex"
          package (i.e. you no longer need an external REGEX library).
          Also note that the "yeti_regex" does not require Yeti to be
          loaded (it is a pure standalone Yorick package).

        - New Built-in functions: is_complex, is_hash, is_integer, is_list,
          is_matrix, is_numerical, is_real, is_scalar, is_string,
          is_vector.

===============================================================================

 * 2005-05-24: yeti-5.3.12 released.

 * 2005-05-02:
        - Changes in 'yeti_plugin.c', 'yeti_misc.c', 'yeti_utils.c' and
          'yeti.i' to avoid problems on 64-bit machines.  A (minor) side
          effect is that addresses in 'mem_*' hack functions must now be
          long integer (i.e. int's are no longer allowed).

 * 2005-04-14:
        - Fix bugs caused by using a nil string (e.g. string(0)) as hash
          key and which trigger segmentation violation interrupt (SIGSEGV).

        - New functions h_first and h_next to scan a hash table.

 * 2005-02-02:
        - Support for reloadable plugins.
        - Complete rewrite of 'configure' script.
        - CP40/GPL support is now provided as a separate plugin.
        - Startup routine '_yeti_init' to provide a more useful list of
          paths for script files (*.i) than the one setup by Yorick.
        - Removed 'yeti_version' function in favor of '_yeti_init' function
          and pre-defined variables YETI_VERSION and YETI_HOME.

 * 2004-10-14: New function "get_includes" to get a list of included files.

===============================================================================

 * 2004-09-27: yeti-5.3.11 released.

 * 2004-09-17: Fix a bug in "arc" and "round" built-in functions which
        triggers when the argument was a non-double scalar (thanks to
        Clémentine Béchet for finding this bug).

 * 2004-09-16: "about" interpreted function can optionally ignore case.

 * 2004-09-15: New interpreted function "h_clone" to clone/copy a hash object.

 * 2004-09-15: Work around Yorick bug with palette in gg_fit_2d_spike.

===============================================================================

 * 2004-09-09: yeti-5.3.10 released.

 * 2004-09-09: Yeti now displays its version number which can be retrieved
        by function yeti_version.

 * 2004-09-09: New built-in function "current_include" to get the path of
        the currently parsed file if any.

 * 2004-03-12: New built-in function "arc" to compute lengh of arc in
        radians.

 * 2004-03-04: Fix built-in "heapsort" to always return a vector (as
        claimed in the doc).

 * 2004-03-03: Avoid Gist markers when drawing widgets in yeti_gist_gui.i.

 * 2004-02-27: Hash table objects can be invoked as a function with a
        member name (syntaxic shortcut for h_get) or with a nil argument to
        get the number of elements.

===============================================================================

 * 2004-02-23: yeti-5.3.8 released.

 * 2004-02-23: Added built-in function "eigen" to compute the spectral
        decomposition of real symetric matrices.
