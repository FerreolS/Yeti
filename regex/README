This directory contains the source files needed for Yeti regular expression
plugin.

If the POSIX regular expression library is not installed in your system,
I've put a copy og GLIBC regular expression routines in directory glibc.
These files rae almost unmodified from their original version (I've left
the original files with a .orig suffix so that you can figure out what I
had to modify).  You can get the full source code of GLIBC at

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc
